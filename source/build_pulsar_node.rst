Building the Pulsar endpoint
============================

After running the pre-tasks recipes and having properly edited
the ``vars.tf`` file (see section :doc:`vars_tf`),
we are ready to create the Pulsar endpoint.

Navigate into the Pulsar infrastructure directory:

::

  cd pulsar-infrastructure

and execute:

::

  WS=<workspace-name> make init

  WS=<workspace-name> make plan

  WS=<workspace-name> make apply

The ``apply`` command output the IP addresses of the Pulsar Central Manager

::

  ...
  openstack_compute_instance_v2.exec-node: Still creating... (10s elapsed)
  openstack_compute_instance_v2.exec-node: Creation complete after 17s (ID: 046f2d5e-5bf8-4e75-8015-4e6a4f96fb9d)

  Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

  Outputs:

  ip_v4_internal = 172.30.135.5
  ip_v4_public = 90.147.170.170
  node_name = vgcn-it02-central-manager.pulsar

Finally, all the resources have been created on OpenStack.

Here, for example, the OpenStack dashboard showing a Pulsar
endpoint with the Central Manager, the NFS server and two worker nodes.

   :scale: 25%
   :align: center

The Pulsar endpoint is now configured, but Pulsar is still turned off.
In the next step we will configure Pulsar to talk to `usegalaxy.eu <https://usegalaxy.eu>`_ RabbitMQ and enable it.

Testing SSH access
----------------------------------

The SSH public key configured in the ``vars.tf`` file was already
automatically added to the ``authorized_keys``
file of the Central Manager VM. To login to this VM just type:

::

  ssh -i <private_ssh_key> <Central-Manager-Public-IP-address> -l centos

.. figure:: _static/img/cm_ssh.png
   :scale: 40%
   :align: center

.. note::

   Terraform scripts also add a VGCN private ssh key to the CM and the public one to the other nodes.
   So after successfully logged in to the CM, you can reach, without other impediments, the rest of the network.
