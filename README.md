# Pulsar networks docs

The Pulsar Network is wide job execution system distributed across several European datacenters, allowing to scale Galaxy instances computing power over heterogeneous resources.

This git repository contains the source of documentation about how to install and configure a Pulsar network endpoint on an OpenStack Cloud infrastructure and how to connect it to [useGalaxy.eu](https://useGalaxy.eu) server.   
The same Pulsar endpoint can be associated to any properly configured Galaxy instance.
